# Python-File-Sharing-APP

Large Efficient Flexible and Trusty (LEFT) Files Sharing application.

This application is based on TCP protocol and achieved using Python socket programming. The application adopts multi-process and multi-threaded technique to support multi-users and realize high efficiency.
The primary purpose of the application is to enable multiple users to share files on a server. Users can upload files and also automatically download files from other users who are connected to the server.

## üöÄ Features

- **Multi-User Support**: Built with multi-process and multi-threaded architecture
- **Real-time File Sharing**: Automatic file synchronization between connected users
- **Automatic compression and decompression**: For large files, automatic file compression and decompression operations to improve efficiency.
- **Breakpoint resume**: After the upload interruption, the user can continue to upload the file from the last breakpoint to avoid repeated operations.
- **Logging system**: Records the download process to provide traceability of user actions.
- **Partial file update**: Users can partially update an uploaded file without re-uploading the entire file.

## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Network connectivity between server and clients

## üîê Security

- TCP protocol ensures reliable data transfer
- Built-in error handling and validation
- Secure file transfer mechanisms
